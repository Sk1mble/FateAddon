Features a few small improvements and tweaks from 3.0 that make it work more reliably with regard to refreshing of the data etc.
As of this release, you can delete one of the Physical or Mental stress conditions and a token will still appear in the StressViewer. 
Delete both, and the token will just be skipped.
The StressViewer will now also display even if it encounters tokens without stress defined.
