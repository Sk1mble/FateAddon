* You can create an Extra with the word 'condition' in it and with _number at the end and this will be changed into number editable checkboxes that are stored with the character sheet. e.g Condition: Indebted_5

* The stress viewer now displays checkboxes and editable consequences. If the GM edits these they will update the underlying data accordingly once they click or tab out of the box. For the StressViewer to work, the character must have an extra named with the words condition, physical, stress which has been initialised as per the above (e.g. by typing Condition: Physical Stress_3)  and an extra with the words condition, mental, stress which must also have been initialised.

As a convenience factor, you might like to create a standard pair of 3-box conditions and save them in your Items to easily drag them to new characters.

The number of boxes on a condition can be updated at any time by adding _n to the end of the name of the condition, where n is the number of boxes required. This will overwrite all data currently in the condition.

Update 2.1 - I have added a Fate Point viewer that lets the GM manipulate the characters' fate points without having to open their sheets. This also keeps track of the GM's fate points for the scene (this is stored in a flag on the GM user).
